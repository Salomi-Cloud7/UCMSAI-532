I wouldn't have even been able to get out of the driveway let alone 45 minutes away to the restaurant and even if by some miracle we were able to get through all that we would have been trapped there for sure after an hour of snowfall which would have been even worse. I told hey look were not going to be able to make it out today but no worries well just go tomorrow. She had a full on melt down like I just told her her mother died crying inconsolably.

There was a woman I've know since elementary school who wanted to wait one more year before being in a serious relationship, and because of our history she was convinced we'd end up together immediately if we dated now. She wanted to do a \"if we're both single in a year\" thing. I understand her reasoning, she's out of a long term relationship and is making the right choice. But I also want to be with someone who really wants to be with me, and I feel like (I know this is irrational, and it's on me and not her) if we got together in a year, she'd be settling because she couldn't find anything better, and I really don't want to be in a relationship where I feel like someone settled for me. And I definitely don't want to be her booty call for the weekends she didn't meet anyone, so I've just sort of backed out of that and returned to the default platonic friend I've always been to her.\n",

We didn't \"date\" but we weren't platonic either. As I got to know her though, I realized she uses a lot of people... she keeps a lot of friends who obviously have a crush on her around for rides, or drinks, or whatever. Also, she's obviously still in love with her high school boyfriend a decade and a half later. I still like hanging out with her once in awhile, but only in a platonic way now, because I'll fall for her if it's anything more (she has all the red flags that match mine lol), and it'll end really bad. I guess that's less losing interest, and more not being interested enough to keep repeating old mistakes.\n",

I’ve been there. But if you want any quality of retirement, you need to start taking advantage of the power of compounding now. If you wait until 40 or 50, it’s too late…unless you win the lottery. No matter how you feel about it, that is the conditions of the U.S. and how we have set up covering our retired ages. That is a massive change, even from your grandparents, many of whom have pensions. Also…take care of your long term health now. Sedentary lifestyles lend themselves to many of the worst morbidities…at earlier ages. And don’t take yourself, or others too seriously in social media or real life. You are just one of billions. We’re not nearly as powerful or knowledgeable about life as we think we are. That’s maybe the hardest one when we’re young.

Emotions attach to the brain’s memory, so much so that the most powerful memories are ones tied to emotional reactions, positive or negative. It’s a survival mechanism; our brain pays close attention to emotion-provoking experiences and associates them with great importance. The more emotional an experience is, the more potent the memory will be. As we age, we have less to discover; our lives become routine and lack excitement and enthusiasm. Over time, a lack of new experiences causes the brain to blur out the mundane day-to-day activities and continuously imprint the memories that were emotionally significant in our youth. \n",

Part of the solution is to restore our passion for adventure by engaging in new experiences that are emotionally invigorating.

The reason being is that something I heavily value in relationships is both people actively working towards equal partnership.  One person covering everything does not feel like partnership to me regardless of who asked who out.  One of the things I like about a first date is that I find them intriguing enough to make time and set aside money in my own awesome (to me anyway) life to get to know them more.  If they aren’t interested in doing the same that communicates that they aren’t as interested or engaged, so why waste anyone’s time?  I also intentionally suggest things that are relatively inexpensive like ice cream at sunset or a drink or two.  It would be very bad partner ish of me to suggest something unreasonably burdensome.\n",

The trick is to be respectful, thank them for communicating some of their values to you, highlighting the difference in yours, and politely pulling g the ripcord.  The few times where the other person has gotten hostile and started throwing insults I simply say that if this is how they react when not getting what they want then I don’t really see a future for us.\n",

There are moments where one of us should pay and moments where a split is fair. Context and situation matter a lot, as do circumstances.  Don't pay for dates with expectations, pay for dates with the idea that you are respecting her effort to share her most precious resource with you; her time.\n",
            "When I was dating I'd assume I was paying, but if my date asked if she could pay for something I'd ask if she was sure before proceeding. I'm cool with paying, but won't argue against switching it up. \n",

            "I won't mind each of us paying their share, or alternating between who will pay, but if they're struggling with money at the time and I'm in a good spot, I'll of course pay, or at least offer to.\n",
            "I’ll generally pay if I think the date’s going nowhere. Like if we’re just not clicking and I’m not really interested in seeing them again. I kind of think of it like a way to safely be like “hey, thanks for your time, no hard feelings.” If the date goes well, I’ll usually ask to split it or lean into a conversation of doing a “I get one, you get the next” type deal (which is my preference) \n",
            "Yup! The first time is a courtesy for accepting the date. Second date, I don't mind. After that? I'd like them to at least offer. If we're going to have a relationship, things should be as equal as possible. Good communication is important for equity.\n",

            "Well, I'll be honest with you, I pay for getting to choose the restaurant in my opinion. I like specific food a lot better than other food, and if I'm paying for it, then I'm picking the restaurant. If she wants me to pay AND pick the restaurant, then it's an immediate deal breaker. I want equality.\n",
            "If I asked her out hell yeah. I know where I’m going because I picked the place, and I’m not cheap. Not being cheap usually gets you laid if that’s all you’re looking for. Just friendly advice for you younger fellas.\n",
            "If I asked her out, then yes I am. I believe if you ask someone to go out with you if that is drinks, food or something that cost money to do I believe the person asking should be expecting to pay unless other wise stated at some point. This goes for friends, family, and other people you are interested in.\n",

            "I always offer and am prepared to, but sometimes they want to split or, in the case they asked me out, sometimes they want to pay. I just go with the flow of whatever direction they go. It is much simpler as all women differ.\n",
